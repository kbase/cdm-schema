    description: IDs are either CURIEs, IRI, or blank nodes. IRIs are wrapped in <>s
      to distinguish them from CURIEs, but in general it is good practice to populate
      the [prefixes][Prefixes.md] table such that they are shortened to CURIEs. Blank
      nodes are ids starting with `_:`.

      A relation graph edge that is inferred. This table contains links between the nodes that appear as subjects in the [Statements](Statements) table. The graph contains all possible links between nodes and is created using a reasoner such as [relation-graph](https://github.com/balhoff/relation-graph) to materialise inferrred links.
