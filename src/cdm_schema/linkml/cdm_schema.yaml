        description: Used for entries without evidence at protein, transcript, or
          homology levels.

  StrandType:
    description: The strand that a feature appears on relative to a landmark. Also encompasses unknown or irrelevant strandedness.
    permissible_values:
      negative:
        description: Represented by "-" in a GFF file; the strand is negative wrt the
          landmark.
      positive:
        description: Represented by "+" in a GFF file; the strand is positive with
          relation to the landmark.
      unknown:
        description: Represented by "?" in a GFF file. The strandedness is relevant but
          unknown.
      unstranded:
        description: Represented by "." in a GFF file; the feature is not stranded.

  # RefSeq status codes:
  # MODEL	The RefSeq record is provided by the NCBI Genome Annotation pipeline and is not subject to individual review or revision between annotation runs.
  # INFERRED	The RefSeq record has been predicted by genome sequence analysis, but it is not yet supported by experimental evidence. The record may be partially supported by homology data.
  # PREDICTED	The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review, and some aspect of the RefSeq record is predicted.
  # PROVISIONAL	The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review. The initial sequence-to-gene association has been established by outside collaborators or NCBI staff.
  # REVIEWED	The RefSeq record has been reviewed by NCBI staff or by a collaborator. The NCBI review process includes assessing available sequence data and the literature. Some RefSeq records may incorporate expanded sequence and annotation information.
  # VALIDATED	The RefSeq record has undergone an initial review to provide the preferred sequence standard. The record has not yet been subject to final review at which time additional functional information may be provided.
  # WGS	The RefSeq record is provided to represent a collection of whole genome shotgun sequences. These records are not subject to individual review or revisions between genome updates.
