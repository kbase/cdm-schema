These are the associations defined in the datasource (i.e., plugin) mapping file. Base Base synthesis model class. AbsoluteCoordinate Absolute coordinate describes the geo-referenced location of a feature. Coordinates match the feature's shape. For example, a curve is a list of points. Currently collections of discrete points describing a feature are supported. Coordinate Top level coordinate class that holds AbsoluteCoordinate or RepresentativeCoordinate HorizontalCoordinate Generic XY coordinates for a point on earth (https://www.fgdc.gov/csdgmgraphical/spref.htm) GeographicCoordinate The latitude and longitude which define the position of a point on the Earth's surface with respect to a reference spheroid (https://www.fgdc.gov/csdgmgraphical/spref.htm). Observation OGC OM_Observation feature type. This is a parent class to which Mixins should be added to create observation types with metadata and result. MeasurementTimeseriesTVPObservation Series of measurement (numerical) observations in TVP format grouped by time (i.e., a time series).Anything specified at the group level automatically applies to the individual observation. Person A person or organization RelatedSamplingFeature Class that represents a related sampling feature and its role relative to the sampling feature to which it is related. Spatial hierarchies of features are built by specifying related sampling features. Data model from OGC Observations and Measurements. RepresentativeCoordinate Representative coordinates describe the location of a feature by a representative shape / location For example, a study area may be represented by the center point. The vertical position from a reference position (e.g., height, depth) is also described in this class. Currently representative points are supported. The class is extendable to other forms of representing (e.g., diameter, area, side_length) Representative point types are also expandable as use cases require. ResultListTVP Result Point Float ResultPointFloat Result Point Float VerticalCoordinate The vertical position of the feature (altitudes or depths). The reference frame or system is specified. AltitudeCoordinate An altitudinal vertical position (i.e., distance from sea level). The reference frame or system is specified. The term \"altitude\" is used instead of the common term \"elevation\" to conform to the terminology in Federal Information Processing Standards 70-1 and 173. DepthCoordinate A depth vertical position (i.e., the height or depth from the specified reference position). The reference frame or system is specified. DataSource Source for data. FeatureAttributes Additional attributes of a feature, parsed from column 9 of a GFF file. FeatureXProtein Captures the relationship between a feature and a protein; equivalent to feature encodes protein. An additional protocol ID may be specified to annotate the protocol used to elucidate or predict the relationship. Identifier An external identifier for an entity. This should be a URI or CURIE. MappedAttribute A data class for an attribute that is translated (i.e., mapped) from a datasource vocabulary to BASIN-3D vocabulary. Note that this model holds an AttributeMapping that maybe compound in nature; however this class specifies only one attribute types. For example, if the AttributeMapping is for a compound mapping of attribute types OBSERVED_PROPERTY:SAMPLING_MEDIUM, the attr_type field would be either OBSERVED_PROPERTY or SAMPLING_MEDIUM but not both.

This may be a primary name, alternative name, synonym, acronym, or any other label used to refer to an entity. NamedThing Abstract class to represent things with names. Event Something that happened. Experiment A discrete scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact. Measurement A qualitative or quantitative observation of an attribute of an object or event against a standardized scale, to enable it to be compared with other objects or events. ProcessedMeasurement A measurement that requires additional processing to generate a result. NamedThingWithId Abstract class to represent things with names and identifiers. Project Administrative unit for collecting data related to a certain topic, location, data type, grant funding, and so on. Protocol Defined method or set of methods . Sample A material entity that can be characterised by an experiment. UniqueNamedThing Represents an entity with a hash value generated from combining its unique attributes. Contig A contig (derived from the word \"contiguous\") is a set of DNA segments or sequences that overlap in a way that provides a contiguous representation of a genomic region. A contig should not contain any gaps. Contigset A set of individual, overlapping contigs that represent the complete sequenced genome of an organism. Genome A contigset with a completeness score of greater than 90% and a contamination score of less than 5%. EncodedFeature An entity generated from a feature, such as a transcript. EnvironmentalContext The environmental context for the event. GoldEnvironmentalContext Environmental context, described using JGI's five level system. MixsEnvironmentalContext Environmental context, described using the MiXS convention of broad and local environment, plus the medium. Feature A feature localized to an interval along a contig. SamplingFeature A feature where sampling is conducted. OGC Observation & Measurements SF_SamplingFeature. SpatialSamplingFeature A spatially-defined feature where sampling is conducted. OGC Observation & Measurements SF_SpatialSamplingFeature. MonitoringFeature A feature upon which monitoring is made. OGC Timeseries Profile OM_MonitoringFeature. Protein Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of one or more long, folded chains of amino acids, whose sequences are determined by the DNA sequence of the protein-encoding gene. ProtocolParticipant Either an input or an output of a protocol. ObservedProperty Defining the properties being observed (measured).

For features that cross the origin of a circular feature (e.g. most bacterial genomes, plasmids, and some viral genomes), the requirement for start to be less than or equal to end is satisfied by making end = the position of the end + the length of the landmark feature. For zero-length features, such as insertion sites, start equals end and the implied site is to the right of the indicated base in the direction of the landmark. from_schema: https://github.com/kbase/cdm-schema rank: 1000 alias: start owner: MonitoringFeature domain_of: - Feature range: integer strand: name: strand description: The strand of the feature. from_schema: https://github.com/kbase/cdm-schema rank: 1000 alias: strand owner: MonitoringFeature domain_of: - Feature range: StrandType source_database: name: source_database description: ID of the data source from which this entity came. from_schema: https://github.com/kbase/cdm-schema rank: 1000 alias: source_database owner: MonitoringFeature domain_of: - Feature range: uriorcurie source_protocol: name: source_protocol description: ID of the protocol used to generate the feature. from_schema: https://github.com/kbase/cdm-schema rank: 1000 alias: source_protocol owner: MonitoringFeature domain_of: - Feature range: Protocol type: name: type description: The type of the feature; constrained to be either a term from the Sequence Ontology or an SO accession number.
