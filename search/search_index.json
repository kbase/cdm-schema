Identifier An external identifier for an entity. This should be a URI or CURIE. MeasurementSet A series of qualitative or quantitative measurements. Name The name or label for an entity. This may be a primary name, alternative name, synonym, acronym, or any other label used to refer to an entity. NamedThing Abstract class to represent things with names. Event Something that happened. Experiment A discrete scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact. Measurement A qualitative or quantitative observation of an attribute of an object or event against a standardized scale, to enable it to be compared with other objects or events. ProcessedMeasurement A measurement that requires additional processing to generate a result. NamedThingWithId Abstract class to represent things with names and identifiers. Project Administrative unit for collecting data related to a certain topic, location, data type, grant funding, and so on. Protocol Defined method or set of methods . Sample A material entity that can be characterised by an experiment. UniqueNamedThing Represents an entity with a hash value generated from combining its unique attributes. Assembly A set of chromosomes, unlocalized and unplaced (random) sequences and alternate loci used to represent an organism's genome or the genomes of a community of organism. Most current assemblies are a haploid representation of an organism's genome, although some loci may be represented more than once. This representation may be obtained from one or more individuals. Contig A contig (derived from the word \"contiguous\") is a set of DNA segments or sequences that overlap in a way that provides a contiguous representation of a genomic region. A contig should not contain any gaps. Contigset A set of individual, overlapping contigs that represent the complete sequenced genome of an organism. Genome A contigset with a completeness score of greater than 90% and a contamination score of less than 5%. EncodedFeature An entity generated from a feature, such as a transcript. EnvironmentalContext The environmental context for the event. GoldEnvironmentalContext Environmental context, described using JGI's five level system. MixsEnvironmentalContext Environmental context, described using the MiXS convention of broad and local environment, plus the medium. Feature A feature localized to an interval along a contig. Protein Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of one or more long, folded chains of amino acids, whose sequences are determined by the DNA sequence of the protein-encoding gene.
