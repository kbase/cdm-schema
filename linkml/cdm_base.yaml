      A string used as a resolvable (external) identifier for an entity. This should be a URI or CURIE. If the string cannot be resolved to an URL, it should be added as a 'name' instead.

      This table is used for capturing external IDs. The internal CDM identifier should be used in the *_id field (e.g. feature_id, protein_id, contig_collection_id).
